# Eruption_Function
Psuedo-3D representation of a surface of a 2-Dimensional function.

I recoded the program in Javascript (using HTML 5 Canvas), GPL (a Professor developed language at Chico State Unversity), SiMPLE (a C-interpreted language developed by Bob Bishop, a former Apple-II developer), and Android for Mobile.

The Javascript version uses a logarithmic curve while GPL implements a tapering cosine.
